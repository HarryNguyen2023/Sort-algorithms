Sorting algorithms are widely used in computer science to arrange the data structure in the ways that might be applied to many different algorithms in solving pratical problems. There are many different sorting approaches, from comparative algorithms like bubble sort, slection sort, insetion sort, shell sort, to non-comparative such as counting sort, radix sort, bucket sort, or divide and conquer algorithms like merge sort and quick sort.
